Keep comments to a reasonable level. Do not overexplain or add/remove comments from unrelated parts of the codebase.

## Game bug reports

Users report game bugs with Lichii logs (`eden_log.txt`, `eden_log.txt.old`). Each `Booting game: <program id>` line starts a session; the build is on the first line (`Lichii Version: ... | nx2-<sha>`). Known program ids:

| Program id | Game |
|---|---|
| 040074A01BF12000 | Donkey Kong Bananza |
| 040077201BE50000 | Kirby Air Riders |

Add ids here when a report identifies a new game.

## Before writing a fix

Lichii is a fork of [Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine). Do not guess, and do not rewrite a fix upstream already has.

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine.git && git fetch upstream`.
2. Check `upstream/nx2`, open and closed PRs, unmerged branches, and issues for the game and symptom (`gh pr list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh issue list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh pr diff <n>`). Read the diffs, not only the titles.
3. If nx2 is behind `upstream/nx2`, merge upstream first. Port an existing upstream fix before writing a new one, and cite its PR or commit.
4. Write a new fix only when nothing upstream addresses the root cause the log shows.

## Debugging tools

Use these before guessing. All are off unless the variable is set; set them in the Command Prompt before starting `nyamu.exe` (`set NAME=VALUE&& C:\Nyamu\build\bin\nyamu.exe`). Read them from the log at `*:Info` unless noted.

| Symptom | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong image (white, black, missing objects, smearing) | `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP=<dir>` with `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_AT=<seconds>`, `<frame>f` or `file` (captures once `<dir>/capture.now` exists; default 60); add `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_SAMPLED=1` for pass inputs | One frame's pass colour targets, dispatch storage images (3D included) and present source; with `_SAMPLED`, every texture each pass samples (`kind: sampled`, with stage, TIC index, 3D and depth included) as `.png` and `.raw.zst`, plus `manifest.jsonl` with shader hashes, formats, addresses and per-channel stats. `python3 -I tools/nx2/frame_dump_index.py <dir>` builds `index.html`. Find the first pass whose output is wrong, then inspect its shaders. |
| Rejected or miscompiled shaders | `EDEN_NX2_SHADER_DUMP=<dir>` | Native programs with `.header.bin` sidecars and `failed-compute-*.env` for failed compute pipelines. Replay offline with `tools/nx2/shader_sweep.py` (see `tools/nx2/shader-sweep.md`). |
| Draw and render-state questions | `EDEN_NX2_RENDER_TRACE=1`, filter `*:Info HW.GPU:Debug Render.Vulkan:Debug Shader:Debug` | Per-draw state, rejected stages and zero-format texture descriptors. |
| Video playback | `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_TRACE=1`, `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_DUMP=<dir>` | Decoder submit, decode and composite trace; decoded frames. |
| Performance and frame pacing | `EDEN_NX2_GPU_PROFILE=1`, `EDEN_DKB_FRAME_TRACE=1` | GPU thread time per second by zone; per-present interval, CPU and fence timing. |
| Which functions a thread spends its time in (Windows) | `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_PROFILE=<hz>` with `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_DELAY=<s>` or `file` (starts once `sample.now` exists in the log directory), `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_SECONDS=<s>` (default 20), `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_THREADS` (default `GPU,GPUBack,VulkanWorker`; `CPUCore_*` adds the guest cores) | `nx2_samples_<pid>.bin` in the log directory. `python3 -I tools/nx2/sample_report.py <file> --exe nyamu.exe [--svg out.svg]` prints self and inclusive time by function and the top call paths per thread (nyamu.pdb next to the exe). Turns the GPU_PROFILE zone timers off. |
| Command corruption or pop-in | `EDEN_NX2_PB_CHECK=1`; A/B with `EDEN_NX2_PB_SNAPSHOT=0` or `EDEN_NX2_FETCH_DRAIN=1` | How many pushbuffer entries change between submit and parse. |
| Split GPU thread races | `EDEN_NX2_SPLIT_CHECK=1` | Reports scheduler use from the wrong thread. |
| Upscaler and DLSS contracts | `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_CONTRACT_TRACE=1` | Inputs and outputs of replaced upscaler networks. |
| Service calls | `EDEN_NX2_IPC_TRACE=1` | IPC command trace. |
| Host crash (log just stops) | Windows minidump in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\nyamu.exe.<pid>.dmp` | Read the exception and stack with the `minidump` Python package, then symbolize with `llvm-symbolizer --obj=nyamu.exe --inlines --relative-address <offset>` next to the build's `nyamu.pdb`. |

## How work is split

- One subagent per game, all running in parallel.
- Small research (upstream PR and issue surveys, log reading): a cheap model, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash at max reasoning when its endpoint is available.
- Hard fixes (emulation, shaders, GPU): GPT-6 Astra at high reasoning.
- When a GPT-6 Astra subagent can't find the cause, switch that subagent to Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning.
- The main thread (Opus) orchestrates and reviews.

## Builds

- Cloud machines build with clang and Ninja for compile and unit-test checks.
- The build the owner tests runs on the owner's Windows PC: Ryzen 7 7800X3D (16 threads), Radeon RX 9070 XT (AMD proprietary driver). Report performance numbers against this rig.
- On the PC the toolchain is clang-cl (LLVM) with the VS 2022 SDK, Qt in `C:/lx/qt` and Ninja, run from an "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022". Source is `C:\Nyamu` and the build dir is `C:\Nyamu\build`. Configure: `cmake -S C:\Nyamu -B C:\Nyamu\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe" "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/lx/qt -DYUZU_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON`; build: `cmake --build C:\Nyamu\build --parallel 16`. The program is `C:\Nyamu\build\bin\nyamu.exe` and logs are in `%APPDATA%\eden\log`.
